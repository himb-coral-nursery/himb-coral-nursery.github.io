The HIMB Coral Nursery is an active in-situ laboratory. Below are our primary areas of research and ongoing experiments.

## 3D Photogrammetry & Monitoring
<a id="photogrammetry"></a>
One of our core ongoing projects is the tracking of coral health and growth through high-resolution imaging. 

By utilizing bi-monthly 3D photogrammetry, we maintain a "living history" of the nursery. This allows us to:
* Track growth rates of specific coral genotypes.
* Monitor bleaching patterns over time.
* Analyze structural complexity and reef accretion.
