## Mission
<a id="mission"></a>
The Coral Nursery at The Hawaiʻi Institute of Marine Biology (HIMB) is a collaborative space where science, restoration, and community intersect. Managed by the **ToBo Lab**, we provide stock coral to various graduate and undergraduate research projects.

## Our History
<a id="history"></a>
The nursery began as a unique restoration effort to save wild-spawned corals that were growing on the netting of decommissioned fish pens. 

Researchers in the ToBo Lab used this opportunity to launch a pilot project to determine if it is possible to farm coral and improve reef restoration using a **floating midwater coral nursery**. After the success of the pilot program, the operation expanded to become a central hub for coral research at HIMB.

## What We Do Now
<a id="current-role"></a>
Today, the nursery serves three main functions:
1.  **Research Supply:** Providing genetically identified stock coral to researchers.
2.  **Long-term Monitoring:** Serving as a living history of bleaching patterns, tracked through bi-monthly **3D photogrammetry**.
3.  **Outreach:** Hosting tours, summer intensive programs, and internships to educate the next generation of marine scientists.
