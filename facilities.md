<!-- SECTION 1: THE NURSERY -->
<div class="section-nursery" markdown="1">

<div class="feature-section">
  <div class="feature-text">
    <h2>docks</h2>
    <p>Our seven 20' x 20' square docks comprise the backbone of the HIMB Coral Nursery. They help support our coral rack system and their 5' width provides ample deck space for you to conduct your research and collect data.</p>

    <h2>frp racks</h2>
    <p>Fiberglass-reinforced plastic (FRP) racks are 4' x 12' platforms used for experiment deployments that require a stable, rigid platform to hold your equipment. These support heavy loads to meet nearly any needs, just ask!</p>

    <h2>flex racks</h2>
    <p>Geotextile racks can be built to nearly any size or shape and work well when FRP is too large or replicate racks spread across the nursery space are desired. This design is useful in experiments involving caging, shading, or higher levels of control.</p>

    <h2>tank system</h2>
    <p>Our 28 land-based, flow-through seawater tanks are available to compliment your in-situ work. They are ideal for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Field quarantine & pest control</li>
      <li>Temperature/bleaching manipulation</li>
      <li>Feeding trials</li>
      <li>Shade/light manipulation</li>
    </ul>

<!-- SECTION 2: THE CORALS -->
<div class="section-corals" markdown="1">

<div class="feature-section">
  <div class="feature-text">
    <h2>nursery colonies</h2>
    <p>The coral nursery houses hundreds of colonies from corals of opportunity, natural recruitment, and past permitted collections. These colonies are available for use in your research and can be referenced in our photogrammetry time-series going back as far as 2019 for some colonies.</p>

  <div class="feature-text">
    <h2>field collections</h2>
    <p>If you are interested in sampling wild coral colonies from the surrounding reefs of Kāne'ohe Bay, we are happy to help you navigate everything from permitting with the state, HIMB boat usage, down to the physical collections in the field. Leverage our familiarity with our home reef to your advantage.</p>

  <div class="feature-text">
    <h2>SfM photogrammetry</h2>
    <p>3D models built with Structure from Motion photogrammetry allow you to measure surface area, benthic cover, volume and more with sub-millimeter accuracy. We offer equipment for use or a full SfM service with data delivered.</p>

  <div class="feature-text">
    <h2>PAM fluorometry</h2>
    <p>Our Waltz mini-PAM fluorometer can assess photosynthetic activity, a common proxy for coral and symbiont health. We are happy to share our equipment, help you use it, and also process the data you receive.</p>

    <h2>environmental monitoring</h2>
    <p>We are equipped with multiple methods of measuring light, temperature, and flow in the nursery:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>LiCor 3 channel PAR meter</li>
      <li>Apogee handheld PAR meter</li>
      <li>Odyssey PAR sensors w/ automated wiper</li>
      <li>HOBO irradiance/temperature loggers</li>
