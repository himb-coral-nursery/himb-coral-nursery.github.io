    <h1 class="page-title">About Us</h1>

    <p>The Coral Nursery at The Hawaiʻi Institute of Marine Biology (HIMB) is a collaborative space where science, restoration, and community intersect.</p>
    <p>Managed by the <a href="https://www.tobolab.org/" target="_blank" style="color: #C2E5DF; font-weight: bold;">ToBo Lab</a>, the HIMB Coral Nursery exsists as a research hub for the University of Hawai'i and our collaborators looking to study Hawaiian reefs.</p>
    <p>Today the Nursery exists as a series of midwater, floating platforms that support thousands of live coral colonies, some of which have lived in the nursery for almost a decade. For more about how the nursery functions, visit our <a href="/facilities/" style="color: #C2E5DF;">facilities page</a> to read more about the space and equipment.</p>
    
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The HIMB Coral Nursery began as an effort to recover corals of oppourtunity growing on decommissioned fish pens at HIMB lead by Drs. Zac Forsman and Ingrid Knapp in 2017. </p>
    <p>After success of the initial pilot, the nursery expanded significantly with new docks in 2025 to its current status. For more, visit our <a href="/history/" style="color: #C2E5DF;">HIMB Coral Nursery history</a> page</p>

    <h2>What We Do Now</h2>
    <p>Today, the nursery serves three main functions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Research Supply:</strong> Providing genetically identified stock coral to researchers.</li>
      <li><strong>Long-term Monitoring:</strong> Serving as a living history of bleaching patterns, tracked through bi-monthly <strong>3D photogrammetry</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Outreach:</strong> Hosting tours, summer intensive programs, and internships to educate the next generation of marine scientists.</li>
    </ol>
