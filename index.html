    <h1 class="page-title">About Us</h1>

    <p>The Coral Nursery at The Hawaiʻi Institute of Marine Biology (HIMB) is a collaborative space where science, restoration, and community intersect. Managed by <a href="https://www.tobolab.org/" target="_blank">the ToBo Lab</a>, the HIMB Coral Nursery exsists as a research hub for the University of Hawai'i and our collaborators looking to study Hawaiian reefs. Today the Nursery exists as a series of midwater, floating platforms that support thousands of live coral colonies, some of which have lived in the nursery for almost a decade. For more about how the nursery functions, visit our <a href="/facilities/" style="color: #C2E5DF;">facilities page</a> to read more about the space and equipment.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The HIMB Coral Nursery began as an effort to recover corals of opportunity growing on decommissioned fish pens at HIMB lead by Drs. Zac Forsman and Ingrid Knapp in 2017. </p>
    <p>After success of the initial pilot, the nursery expanded significantly with new docks in 2025 to its current status. For more, visit our <a href="/history/">HIMB Coral Nursery history</a> page</p>

    <h2>The HIMB Coral Nursery serves 3 main functions today</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Coral Stock and Storage:</strong> We provide storage opportunities for corals of opportunity which can then be used for research and outplanting.</li>
      <li><strong>Experimental Space:</strong> The Nursery serves as an in-situ space where scientists and students can deploy their experiments adjacent to a live reef without disturbing the natural environment or the need for field permits.</li>
      <li><strong>Outreach:</strong> We frequently host tours, summer intensive programs, and internships to educate our locaal community, visitors, and the next generation of marine scientists.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Support & Funding</h2>
    <p>Our work is made possible by the following partners and funders:</p>
    <ul>
          <li>The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI)</li>
