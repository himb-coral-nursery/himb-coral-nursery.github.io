    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>The Coral Nursery at The Hawaiʻi Institute of Marine Biology (HIMB) is a collaborative space where science, restoration, and community intersect. Managed by the <strong>ToBo Lab</strong>, we provide stock coral to various graduate and undergraduate research projects.</p>

    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p>The nursery began as a unique restoration effort to save wild-spawned corals that were growing on the netting of decommissioned fish pens.</p>
    <p>Researchers in the ToBo Lab used this opportunity to launch a pilot project to determine if it is possible to farm coral and improve reef restoration using a <strong>floating midwater coral nursery</strong>. After the success of the pilot program, the operation expanded to become a central hub for coral research at HIMB.</p>

    <h2>What We Do Now</h2>
    <p>Today, the nursery serves three main functions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Research Supply:</strong> Providing genetically identified stock coral to researchers.</li>
      <li><strong>Long-term Monitoring:</strong> Serving as a living history of bleaching patterns, tracked through bi-monthly <strong>3D photogrammetry</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Outreach:</strong> Hosting tours, summer intensive programs, and internships to educate the next generation of marine scientists.</li>
    </ol>
